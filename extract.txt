Game theory is a set of tools used to help analyze situations where an
individual’s best course of action depends on what others do or are
expected to do. Game theory allows us to understand how people act in
situations where they are interconnected.
Connections between people arise in all sorts of situations. Sometimes
through cooperation with others we can achieve more than we can on our
own. Other times conflict arises where an individual benefits at the
expense of others. And in many situations, there are benefits to
cooperation but elements of conflict also exist.
Because game theory can help analyze any environment where a person’s
best action depends on others’ behaviour, it has proven useful in a wide
variety of fields.
In economics, the decisions of firms are affected by their expectations of a
competitor’s choice of product, price and advertising.
In political science, a candidate’s policy platform is influenced by the policy
announcements of their rival.
In biology, animals must compete for scarce resources, but can be hurt if
they are too aggressive with the wrong rival.
In computer science, networked computers compete for bandwidth.
In sociology, public displays of non-conformist attitudes are influenced by
others’ behaviour, which is shaped by social culture.
Game theory is useful whenever there is strategic interaction, whenever
how well you do depends on the actions of others as well as your own
choices. In these cases, people’s actions are influenced by their
expectations of others’ actions.
Game theory is the study of strategic interaction. Strategic interaction is
also the key element of most board games, which is where it gets its name.
Your decision affects the other player’s actions and vice versa. Much of the
jargon of game theory is borrowed directly from games. The decision
makers are called players.
